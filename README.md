# label_data
Some scripts for hand-labelling drone racing gates

## How to use
Put the images in the directory data_dir = "data/images/" (or change data_dir to suit)
Define what you'd like your json files to be called

Click on the points of the gate. If you screw up you can press 'esc' and it will reset for that image. Once the image is labelled it will automatically give you the next image, but you can go back and do it again by pressing 'right arrow'.

Use the arrow keys to skip forward and backward through the images. If you skip an image, it simply won't be labelled.
